		<h1>WIRE FRAME</h1>
		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p align="justify">Customers need to recognize how a proposed feature will work. 
		But simply describing to them verbally or textually for the targeted
		feature to be built may be quite challenging for their imagination.
		Wireframing can be extremely helpful in squaring that circle,
		as it can be served as a "show, don't tell" visual mock-up tool for
		confirming system design ideas with customers.</p>
		<h2>BENEFITS OF WIREFRAMING</h2>
		<p align="justify"> A wireframe is only a low-fidelity version of a user interface and is not meant
		to be a representation of real screen. Website wireframes are intended to be used to demonstrate functionalities,
		user interactions and screen flows of web pages, without explicitly specifying how screen components should look
		like and how the components should behave in order to achieve the highest usability. Comparing to prototyping or
		any kind of detailed screen designs, wireframe features the following advantages:</P>
		<p align="justify">Easy to draw: Wireframe has a simple and clean layout. It is formed by simple screen elements without any detailed styling and formatting.
		<p align="justify">Easy to understand: Wireframe is welcomed by both the development team and business people. It is so simple that everyone can understand without learning.
		<p align ="justify">Easy to modify: You don't need any programming to visualize new design ideas.
		<p align="justify">No coding required: No heavy prototyping and no coding. You just need to draw the wireframe as if you are using a drawing tool.
		<p align="justify">In-line annotations: Annotate design ideas in-place with the help of annotation shapes. These annotations can be shown in requirement specification as well.
		<h3>WHY WIREFRAMING WITH VISUAL PARADIGM?</h3>
		<p align="justift">Visual Paradigm's wireframing tool is so intuitive that helps you mock-up much Faster & Smarter.
		Sketch-style wireframes encourages brainstorming and focus the conversation on content and interaction rather than the detailed design of the user interface.
		In addition to website wireframe tools, Visual Paradigm's wireframe toolset features different devices style (tablet, desktop, iPad, iPhone and Android) with different components or orientation at your choice.
		Wireframes can be modelled as parent and child frame relationship for more effective editing and management. Changes are synchronized to child frames instantly. No more rework is needed!
		Embedding screenshot in wireframe is so convenient by using the build-in screen capturing tool.
		Wireframes are seamlessly integrated with use case and agile user story scenario modeling process, complementing the concern of UX in requirements gathering.
		Playback viewer enables you to shows storyboard as a series of cross device wireframes in screen flow. Customer knows how the proposed working software is supposed to be behaved or in-action.
